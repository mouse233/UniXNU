## State

XNU runs on eight CPUs and mounts the UFS userdata root. `launchd`, SystemOS and SpringBoard start, and the text console works. SpringBoard restarts while the display client opens without presenting a frame.

Adreno 810 and GMU integration are in development. Display presentation and GPU execution require device results.
